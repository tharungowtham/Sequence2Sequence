# Sign Language Translator

## Overview
This project aims to create a cloud-based sign language translator for the deaf community. It utilizes AWS for cloud development, a Seq2Seq model for Natural Language Processing (NLP), Unreal Engine 5 for animations, Flask for the backend, and Websockets for communication.

## Features
- Converts English text and voice input to sign language animations in real-time.
- Utilizes AWS for scalable and reliable cloud deployment.
- Implements Seq2Seq model for NLP to understand and translate text.
- Generates realistic sign language animations using Unreal Engine 5.
- Enables communication through Websockets for seamless interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **AWS**: Cloud platform for hosting and deploying the application.
- **Seq2Seq Model**: Neural network architecture for NLP tasks.
- **Unreal Engine 5**: Powerful game engine for creating lifelike animations.
- **Flask**: Micro web framework for the backend.
- **Websockets**: Enables bidirectional communication between client and server.

## Usage
1. Input English text or voice into the application.
2. The Seq2Seq model processes the input and translates it into sign language.
3. Realistic sign language animations are generated using Unreal Engine 5.
4. Users can view the animations in real-time.
5. Communication between client and server is facilitated through Websockets.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tharungowtham/Sequence2Sequence.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure AWS credentials and services.
4. Train the Seq2Seq model using provided data.
5. Set up Unreal Engine 5 project for animation generation.
6. Implement Flask for the backend API.
7. Implement Websockets for communication.
